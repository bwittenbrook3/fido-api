	h1 Welcome

	p We are building on the working dog and handler interaction work that Melody Jackson, Thad Starner, Clint Zeagler and the entire FIDO team have done. Our project focuses on K9 and human law enforcement interaction, specifically around facilitating communication between K9s and the law enforcement officers, whether about illegal substances, bombs, or firearms from multiple locations / suspects. K9 officers and their handlers have a strong bond and communication, however this communication faces obstacles with noisy locations, distance, and crowded spaces. In addition, other officers assigned as backup often lack the experience to read the cues from the K9 and hinder the speed and effectiveness of the K9 and handler. This is why our focus is on improving the communication between K9, handler, and groups of law enforcement officers. We hope that our project will help to make working conditions safer for the law enforcement officers, K9s and the public, making it something that goes beyond simply providing a nifty technical tool, into a project that has the potential to save lives.
